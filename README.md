Protects against reentrancy attacks by using a locking mechanism.
2. Check Effects Interactions:
function transfer(address _to, uint _amount) external {
    require(balance[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
    
    balance[msg.sender] -= _amount;

    // Ensure state changes are completed before external calls
    (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
Ensures that state changes are completed before making external calls to prevent unexpected behavior.
Best Practices:
1. Code Audits:
Regularly conduct code audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
2. Use Latest Compiler Versions:
Keep Solidity compiler versions up to date to benefit from security improvements.
3. Secure Ether Handling:
Use transfer or send for Ether transfers and avoid using call directly.
4. Reentrancy Protection:
Implement reentrancy protection mechanisms, like the reentrancy guard mentioned above.
5. Gas Limit Considerations:
Be mindful of gas limits to avoid potential out-of-gas issues.
7. Documentation:
Thoroughly document your code to enhance readability and ease of understanding.
This cheat sheet covers the fundamental and essential concepts related to interfaces, libraries, design patterns, security considerations, and best practices in Solidity development. Always prioritize security and stay informed about the latest developments in the Ethereum ecosystem
